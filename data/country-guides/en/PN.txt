# Travel Guide: Complete Travel Guide

## Best Time to Visit
**Summer (December-March)::** Peak season with warmest weather (20-26°C), minimal rainfall, and best conditions for outdoor activities. Ideal for hiking, swimming, and exploring the rugged terrain, though limited accommodation requires advance booking months in advance.

**Autumn (April-May)::** Pleasant temperatures with moderate rainfall, fewer crowds, and stable weather patterns. Excellent for cultural immersion and meeting locals, with comfortable conditions for exploring historical sites and engaging with the tiny community.

**Winter (June-August)::** Cooler temperatures (15-20°C) with increased rainfall and occasional rough seas affecting supply ships. Lower visitor numbers create intimate experiences with the 50-person community, though weather can limit outdoor activities.

**Spring (September-November)::** Warming temperatures with variable weather, wildflower blooms, and improving sea conditions. Good value season with authentic island experiences before peak visitor period begins, ideal for photography and nature observation.
