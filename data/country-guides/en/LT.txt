# Travel Guide: Complete Travel Guide

## Best Time to Visit
**Summer (June-August)::** Peak season offers the warmest weather (18-25°C), longest daylight hours, and best conditions for outdoor activities, festivals, and beach visits along the Baltic coast. Tourist crowds are highest during July and August, resulting in increased accommodation prices and advance booking requirements for popular destinations. The famous White Nights phenomenon provides nearly 19 hours of daylight in June, perfect for extensive sightseeing and cultural activities. This period sees numerous outdoor festivals, concerts, and cultural events throughout the country.

**Spring (April-May)::** Mild temperatures (8-18°C) and blooming landscapes make this an excellent time for city exploration and countryside visits with fewer crowds and moderate accommodation prices. The weather can be unpredictable with occasional rain, but the emerging greenery and comfortable temperatures create ideal conditions for walking tours and outdoor activities. Many attractions reopen after winter closures, while restaurants extend outdoor seating as temperatures warm.

**Autumn (September-October)::** Cool temperatures (10-16°C) and stunning fall foliage create spectacular scenery for photography and outdoor activities, while tourist crowds diminish significantly after summer. This season offers excellent value with lower accommodation prices and authentic local experiences as daily life returns to normal post-tourist season. Weather remains generally stable in September but becomes increasingly unpredictable in October with more frequent rain.

**Winter (November-March)::** Cold temperatures (-5 to 3°C) transform Lithuania into a winter wonderland with potential snow, Christmas markets, and cozy indoor cultural activities. This low season offers the best accommodation deals and intimate experiences with local culture, though daylight hours are severely limited (as few as 6 hours in December). Winter activities include ice skating, traditional saunas, and exploring Lithuania's rich indoor cultural attractions without summer crowds.
