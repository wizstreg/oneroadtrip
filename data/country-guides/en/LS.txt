# Travel Guide: Complete Travel Guide

## Best Time to Visit
**Summer (October-March)::** The warm season offers the best weather for hiking, horseback riding, and outdoor activities with temperatures ranging from 15-25°C during the day and mild nights. This period brings occasional thunderstorms and rain, keeping the landscape green and waterfalls flowing at their peak. Tourist numbers are highest during December-January holidays, resulting in increased accommodation prices and advance booking requirements. The mountain passes are most accessible, and all activities operate at full capacity during this season.

**Winter (May-August)::** The cold, dry season transforms Lesotho into a snow-covered wonderland, with temperatures dropping to -10°C at night and rarely exceeding 15°C during the day. This is the best time for experiencing authentic Basotho culture around warm fires and traditional winter activities, though outdoor pursuits become challenging due to cold temperatures. Snow can close mountain passes and make remote areas inaccessible, but the dramatic winter landscapes provide spectacular photography opportunities. Accommodation prices drop significantly outside ski areas.

**Autumn (March-May)::** This excellent shoulder season offers comfortable temperatures (10-20°C), clear skies, and spectacular autumn colors across the mountains, making it ideal for photography and hiking. Tourist crowds thin out after summer, resulting in lower accommodation prices and more authentic local interactions. Weather remains stable and predictable, while mountain visibility is often at its best due to clear atmospheric conditions. Many consider this the optimal time for visiting Lesotho's highlands.

**Spring (August-October)::** The warming season brings wildflowers, flowing rivers from snowmelt, and increasingly comfortable temperatures, though nights remain cold until late October. This period offers excellent value with low accommodation prices and few tourists, while weather becomes increasingly reliable for outdoor activities. Mountain passes reopen as snow melts, providing access to remote areas that were inaccessible during winter months. Wildflower displays in September and October create spectacular natural scenery.
