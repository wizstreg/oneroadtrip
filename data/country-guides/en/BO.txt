## Best Time to Visit
**Dry Season (May-October)::** Best weather overall, minimal rainfall, clearer skies, ideal for Salar de Uyuni, peak tourist season.

**Wet Season (November-April)::** Heavy rains, challenging road conditions, Salar de Uyuni becomes mirror-like, lush landscapes, fewer tourists.

**Shoulder Seasons (April-May, October-November)::** Good weather transitions, moderate crowds, reasonable prices, excellent for most activities.

**High Altitude Considerations::** La Paz and Altiplano best visited during dry season, less altitude sickness risk with clear weather.
