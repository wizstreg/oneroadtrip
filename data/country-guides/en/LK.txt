# Travel Guide: Complete Travel Guide

## Best Time to Visit
**Dry Season - West and South (December-March)::** This period offers the best weather for exploring Colombo, the southern beaches, and hill country regions with minimal rainfall, comfortable temperatures (26-30°C), and calm seas perfect for beach activities. Tourist crowds reach their peak during December and January holidays, resulting in higher accommodation prices and advance booking requirements. The monsoon winds from the northeast create ideal surfing conditions on the south coast, while the hill country enjoys cool, clear weather perfect for tea plantation visits and hiking.

**Dry Season - East and North (May-September)::** The eastern and northern coasts experience their dry season during these months, offering excellent beach weather, calm seas, and minimal rainfall while the west coast faces monsoon conditions. This period provides opportunities to explore less crowded eastern beaches like Arugam Bay and Trincomalee, along with northern cultural sites like Jaffna and Anuradhapura. Temperatures remain warm (28-32°C) with lower humidity levels, making this ideal for wildlife viewing and outdoor activities in the eastern regions.

**Shoulder Seasons (April and October-November)::** These transitional periods offer the best value for money with moderate weather conditions across most regions, though brief afternoon showers are common as monsoon patterns shift. Tourist crowds diminish significantly, resulting in lower accommodation prices and more authentic local experiences. April can be quite hot (30-35°C) before the rains begin, while October-November provides pleasant post-monsoon conditions with lush green landscapes and refreshed waterfalls throughout the island.

**Monsoon Seasons (Southwest: May-September, Northeast: October-January)::** While challenging for beach activities, monsoon periods offer unique experiences including spectacular waterfalls, lush green landscapes, and dramatically reduced tourist crowds. The southwest monsoon affects the western and southern coasts but often brings only afternoon showers, allowing morning sightseeing and cultural activities. Budget travelers can find excellent accommodation deals during monsoon periods, while the rain enhances the island's natural beauty and fills reservoirs and waterways.
