# Travel Guide: Complete Travel Guide

## Best Time to Visit
**Cool Dry Season (November-February)::** Best weather with comfortable temperatures (20-28°C), minimal rainfall, and clear skies. Traditionally peak tourist season, though current political situation severely limits tourism.

**Hot Dry Season (March-May)::** Very hot temperatures (30-40°C) making travel challenging, especially midday. Limited tourist activities due to extreme heat, early morning and evening activities preferable.

**Monsoon Season (June-October)::** Heavy rainfall, high humidity, flooding possible in some areas. Some regions become inaccessible, though temperatures moderate (25-32°C) and landscapes become lush.

**Post-Monsoon (October-November)::** Transitional period with decreasing rains, comfortable temperatures, and fresh landscapes. Traditionally good travel weather when tourism was more accessible.

**Important Note::** Check current political situation and government travel advisories. The 2021 military coup has severely disrupted tourism, with ongoing civil unrest affecting safety and accessibility.
