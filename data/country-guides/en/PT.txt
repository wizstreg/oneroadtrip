## Best Time to Visit
**Late Spring (April-June)::** Perfect weather conditions (18-25°C) with mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and blooming landscapes. Ideal for exploring cities, coastal areas, and countryside with comfortable conditions and fewer crowds than summer.

**Early Autumn (September-October)::** Excellent temperatures after summer heat, warm ocean waters, and stable weather patterns. Best time for beach activities combined with cultural exploration, moderate prices and pleasant conditions.

**Winter (November-March)::** Mild temperatures (10-18°C) with increased rainfall but lowest prices and authentic experiences. Good for cultural immersion, indoor attractions, and experiencing Portuguese daily life without tourist crowds.

**Summer (July-August)::** Peak season with hottest weather (25-35°C), highest prices, and largest crowds. Perfect for beach holidays but challenging for extensive sightseeing in inland areas due to heat intensity.
