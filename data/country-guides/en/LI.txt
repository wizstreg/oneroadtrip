This season offers excellent photography opportunities with snow-capped peaks contrasting against green valleys and colorful wildflowers. Some higher altitude hiking trails may remain closed due to snow, but valley walks and cultural attractions are fully accessible.

This period sees the highest accommodation prices and largest crowds, particularly on weekends when visitors arrive from neighboring Switzerland and Austria.

Advanced booking is essential for hotels and restaurants.

**Fall (September-November)::** Autumn provides crisp, clear weather (8-18°C) with stunning foliage colors throughout the Rhine Valley and mountain slopes, creating spectacular scenery for hiking and photography. Tourist crowds diminish significantly after summer, resulting in lower accommodation prices and more intimate experiences at attractions.
