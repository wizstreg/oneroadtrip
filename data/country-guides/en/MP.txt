## Best Time to Visit
**Dry Season (December-May)::** Best weather with lower humidity, minimal rainfall, and comfortable temperatures (24-29°C). Peak tourist season with highest accommodation rates but ideal conditions for all activities.

**Shoulder Season (November, June)::** Good weather with brief showers, moderate prices, and fewer crowds. Still excellent for beach activities and sightseeing with comfortable conditions.

**Wet Season (July-October)::** Higher humidity, more rainfall, and potential typhoons, but warmer ocean temperatures. Lower accommodation rates and fewer tourists, though weather monitoring essential.

**Typhoon Season (August-November)::** Potential for tropical storms requiring flexible travel plans and comprehensive insurance. However, many storms pass without major impact to tourism.
