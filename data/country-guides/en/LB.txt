# Travel Guide: Complete Travel Guide

## Best Time to Visit
**Spring (March-May)::** Spring offers Lebanon at its most beautiful, with mild temperatures ranging from 15-25°C and the countryside bursting into bloom. This is peak season for outdoor activities like hiking in the mountains and exploring ancient ruins. Hotel prices are moderate to high, and popular destinations can be crowded, especially during Easter celebrations. The weather is perfect for visiting both coastal cities and mountain regions, though occasional spring showers are possible.

**Summer (June-August)::** Summer brings hot, humid weather to coastal areas (25-35°C) but pleasantly warm conditions in the mountains. This is peak tourist season with the highest prices and largest crowds, particularly in July and August. Beach activities are at their best, and the mountain resorts offer cool escapes from the heat. Many festivals and cultural events take place during summer months, making it vibrant but expensive.

**Fall (September-November)::** Fall is considered by many as the ideal time to visit Lebanon, with comfortable temperatures (20-28°C), fewer crowds, and moderate prices. The weather remains warm enough for swimming in September and October, while mountain areas offer perfect hiking conditions. Tourist sites are less crowded, and accommodation prices drop from summer peaks. The harvest season brings excellent local produce and wine festivals.

**Winter (December-February)::** Winter transforms Lebanon into a ski destination, with snow-covered mountains and skiing at resorts like Faraya and Cedars. Coastal areas remain mild (10-18°C) with occasional rain, while mountains can be quite cold with heavy snowfall. This is low season for beach tourism but peak season for winter sports. Accommodation prices vary greatly between coastal and mountain areas, with ski resorts being most expensive.
