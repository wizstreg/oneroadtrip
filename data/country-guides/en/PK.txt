**Spring (March-May)::** Best weather in most regions with comfortable temperatures (15-25°C) and blooming landscapes. Ideal for mountain regions and cultural sites when security permits.

**Autumn (October-November)::** Excellent weather with clear skies and comfortable temperatures. Best time for northern areas and mountain trekking with stable conditions.

**Winter (December-February)::** Cold in northern mountains but pleasant in southern regions (10-20°C). Limited mountain access due to snow, though cultural sites remain accessible.
