<h1>About OneRoadTrip</h1>
<p class="tagline">Planning a road trip today means juggling dozens of tabs, Google Maps, sometimes unreliable blogs, screenshots, and scattered notes. OneRoadTrip changes the game.</p>

<section>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>OneRoadTrip was born from a crazy idea that took root in the mind of a fifty-something passionate about travel and new technologies. Unable to find what he was looking for in existing apps, he decided to create his own website with the help of artificial intelligence, as his programming knowledge wasn't sufficient.</p>
<p>The adventure began in late August 2025, after the summer holidays, as he opened his Excel spreadsheet to prepare his February 2026 road trip to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>He asked an AI if it could help him build a complex website. It answered: yes.</p>
<p>And within seconds, the first page appeared. Four months later, after many early mornings, late nights, and hardworking weekends — all while holding down a demanding job — OneRoadTrip is nearly complete, though new features are expected to roll out soon.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>What OneRoadTrip Offers</h2>
<p>The concept evolved dramatically from the original idea (an improved Excel spreadsheet) to the final result. On OneRoadTrip, you can:</p>
<ul class="features">
<li>Choose from hundreds of ready-made itineraries and use them as-is or customize them however you like</li>
<li>Build your own itinerary by selecting from over 4,500 locations already listed worldwide, one by one, or by importing any web page you find interesting (main attractions, a blogger's route, etc.) using the tool that transforms the page into structured data with coordinates and activities</li>
<li>Set a starting and ending point and let the system suggest stops that you can always modify...</li>
<li>Book hotels, flights, cars, activities, tours...</li>
<li>Keep your entire itinerary in a dashboard to access on the go</li>
<li>Print your itinerary in a professional format or view it online</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming soon: share your trip with friends, use AI to identify what you're looking at, geolocate yourself relative to points of interest, find direct flights from your airport... Many of these features are already in development, but we'll only release them if the site finds its audience.</p>

</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The Role of AI</h2>
<p>AI helped us build the site based on our instructions.</p>
<p>AI also transforms locations or itineraries found online into importable OneRoadTrip routes, without inventing anything.</p>
<p>Once the itinerary is created, you can check on the map that everything is in the right order and make corrections if needed.</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>Artificial intelligence invents nothing.</strong> It structures, extracts, and organizes existing information, always verifiable on the map. The user retains final control.</p>
</div>
<p>The pre-built itineraries you'll find were mostly created by copying a tourism office page and instructing the AI: "Provide coordinates for these places, estimated visit times, indicate suggested visits and activities, and build an itinerary in a logical order."</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Listed Locations</h2>
<p>The 4,500 locations currently listed come from itineraries we built to test the tool. They will have more and more little siblings.</p>
<p>Each location is rated. We don't claim to know every place and we haven't copied existing guides. So we invented an algorithm that searches for each location: hotels, restaurants, historical sites, attractions, parks, UNESCO sites, Wikipedia pages, tours we offer in our itineraries. Then each location receives a score proportional to what comes up.</p>
<p>Finally, each location is compared to other nearby locations, then national ones, then global ones. A score out of 10 is assigned along with a star rating. This score, probably imperfect, will be weighted by user ratings (25%) and OneRoadTrip's rating (25%) in the future.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>The tool searches for royalty-free photos (4 to 8) for each location and stores links.</p>
<p>The search is complicated. I'll let you imagine what we get when we search for Granada.</p>
<div class="note-box">
<p>We try to review the results but when you have 4,500 locations to check × 8 photos, you can imagine that some weird photos might slip through. <strong>Please report</strong> any photos that seem strange or unrelated to the location in question, and we'll remove them.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Itineraries</h2>
<p>OneRoadTrip is a new site. Created by one person outside of working hours. For three months, we worked hard to create the site, sometimes through trial and error.</p>
<p>Some itineraries, often the oldest ones, may not seem very interesting. They will be replaced as you give us feedback. AI was central to the project at the start; it's now a controlled tool.</p>
<p>But we don't claim to bring you absolute truth. Only to give you ideas so you can build the trip of your dreams yourself.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Is OneRoadTrip Free?</h2>
<p>Yes, completely. Although a paid version is being developed to fund certain additional features we have to pay for ourselves (AI, storage, etc.).</p>
<p>Currently, all features are free. You can use all existing itineraries, modify them, create your own on a list or map, easily reorganize, and edit activities and visits very simply.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How Does OneRoadTrip Make Money?</h2>
<p>When you click on hotel, tour, or flight links, OneRoadTrip earns a small commission on each booking you make. You don't pay any extra, but you help OneRoadTrip continue to exist, because maintaining the site, beyond the time invested, costs money.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Partnerships</h2>
<p>We offer partnerships to travel creators — a dedicated page exists for them — first to spread the word about the site and because we believe our tool will be useful to them.</p>
<p>We're also considering partnerships with major travel forums or websites that would like to offer their audience a planning tool as comprehensive as OneRoadTrip.</p>
<p>If you're a travel content creator, blogger, or manage a community of travelers, contact us to discuss a collaboration.</p>
</section>

<div class="contact-box">
<p>A question, suggestion, or partnership inquiry?</p>
<p><a href="mailto:contact@oneroadtrip.fr">contact@oneroadtrip.fr</a></p>
</div>

<p class="closing">OneRoadTrip is still young, but the ambition is clear: to become the go-to tool for everyone who wants to travel smartly, freely, without depending on a catalog or an opaque algorithm.</p>
